The files contained in this .zip file (NGS_GRAVD_Block_CN03_BETA1.zip) constitute the full first release of GRAV-D data for the CS02 data block. Descriptions of the file contents included in this .zip file are below:

1. NGS_GRAVD_Data_Block_CN03_User Manual (pdf)
This manual should be the second resource for all data users. The manual describes in detail the location of the block; surveys that contributed data to this block; instruments and methodology used in collecting and processing the data that were different from those described in the general user manual; and error analysis for GPS and gravity products. The manual also contains several figures with maps of the data and data area.

2. NGS_GRAVD_Block_CN03_Gravity_Data (txt)
This is the main data file, containing NGS' official BETA1 full-field airborne gravity product. This product has not had the mean field removed, nor been corrected for altitude. Also, the product has not been leveled in any way. We consider this to be the most useable product available, so that users can calculate anomalies or disturbances themselves to whichever datums they are working with. The data file format is found in Appendix A.6 of the general user manual.
Best viewed in Wordpad, Word, or a similar program.

3. NGS_GRAVD_Block_CN03_Supplement1 (txt) (optional- may not exist)
This file contains supplementary data. Supplementary data are defined as data that will not be used in NGS' gravimetric geoids and include: cross lines, transit flights, and other target-of-opportunity flights conducted within the data block. The file format is the same as the main data file.
Best viewed in Wordpad, Word, or a similar program.

4. NGS_GRAVD_Block_CN03_Extent (kml)
This is a GoogleEarth file that contains the block extent. This block extent is also viewable on the Google Map interface of the block's data release webpage.

5. NGS_GRAVD_Block_CN03_Lines (kml)
This is a GoogleEarth file that contains the actual locations of the line data released in the main data file. The lines are clickable for basic information such as line number and date data was collected. These lines are also viewable on the Google Map interface of the block's data release webpage.

6. NGS_GRAVD_Block_CN03_FGDCmetadata (txt)
This is a text file containing the xml metadata for the block, according to FGDC standards. This metadata can also be found online at: http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/dataexplorer/
