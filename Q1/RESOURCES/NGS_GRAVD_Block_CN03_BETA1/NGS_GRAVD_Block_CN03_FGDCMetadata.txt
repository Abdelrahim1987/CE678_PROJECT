    Description:
      Abstract: Airborne gravity data for Nebraska collected in 2014 over one survey. This data set is part of the Gravity for the Re-definition of the American Vertical Datum (GRAV-D) project initiated by NOAA's National Geodetic Survey to collect and monitor gravity data suitable for the re-definition of the vertical datum for at least the United States and territories. The data is available at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/GRAV-D/data_cn03.shtml in ASCII text format.
      Purpose: These data sets were collected and processed by NOAA's National Geodetic Survey (www.ngs.noaa.gov) as part of its GRAV-D effort to modernize the U.S. vertical datum. The purpose of these data is to provide accurate gravity data for geoid modeling for the U.S. and its territories. It was designed to provide medium wavelength gravity information (around 20-400 km) to connect satellite and ground gravity measurements.

  Data_Quality_Information:
    Attribute_Accuracy:
      Attribute_Accuracy_Report: The absolute accuracy of airborne gravity is difficult to quantify. The following measures are indicators of data quality, but are not definitive measures. The cross over precision is 2.11 mGals, which is a combination of differences between cross track and data track and may not be indicative of data quality. Adjacent data lines have an average cross-correlation of 87.43%. Low correlation between adjacent lines may indicate either poor quality on one of the two lines or rapidly changing features. More detailed information can be found at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/GRAV-D/data_cn03.shtml.
    Logical_Consistency_Report: Data processing is fully automated and output file is computer generated. All lines are checked by an analyst and any errors in production are corrected. More detailed information can be found at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/GRAV-D/data_cn03.shtml.
    Completeness_Report: Due to the altitude, speed of data collection, and track spacing of 10 kilometers the resolution of these data are limited to 20 kilometers. More detailed information can be found at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/GRAV-D/data_cn03.shtml.
    Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: GPS horizontal positions are good to 0.009 meters average standard deviation. More detailed information can be found at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/GRAV-D/data_cn03.shtml.
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
        Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report: GPS vertical positions are good to 0.008 meters average standard deviation. More detailed information can be found at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/GRAV-D/data_cn03.shtml.
