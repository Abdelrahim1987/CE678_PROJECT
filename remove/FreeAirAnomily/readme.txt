This folder has 4 functions
1. calc_free_air_anomaly - outputs free air anomaly
2. calc_FAC.m - outputs free air correction
3. calc_gnorm_ellip_surface - outputs normal gravity values
4. make_Ellipsoid - outputs ellipsoid parameters

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For finding free air anomaly , you need to have 4 inputs

1. Latitudes (in degrees)
2. Observed gravity values corresponding the latitudes
3. Ellipsoidal heights (m) corresponding the latitudes
4. Ellipsoidal parameters - this can be obtained using make_Ellispoid function
