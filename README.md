This is our main working folder. Our project is very big , so this will help keeping track of the changes made by each member and organise our code.
### HOW TO USE
Take note of these points - 
#### 1. Organisation
1. 'project.ipynb' is the master jupyter notebook where all the finalised code is written 
2. There are folders named 'Q1','Q2',... 'Q11' in which all the files regarding those questions will be put
#### 2. Working
0. First learn how to use github - watch any  youtube video , you will understand.
tip - If you are new to github, download github desktop for faster working because command line tools will overwhelm you the first time.

1. If you want to start working, then take the project from master branch and start working
2. When done, merge into the master branch.
3. IMP - WRITE APPROPRIATE COMMENTS IN THE  FILE 'project.ipynb' WITH YOUR NAME IN IT.
4. IMP - Explain the steps [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/uun1m9xwssywjvfamsoll/CE678-LAB.paper?dl=0&rlkey=nuggb6ffqvkql010m8ll3uwtx) you have to take in your answer (just an overview) for others to understand and not waste their time to reach up to you.
